## Design Patterns Used

The Online Shopping App incorporates the following design patterns to achieve modularity, flexibility, and maintainability:

- **Builder Pattern:** Used to construct complex objects step by step, providing flexibility in object creation.
- **Strategy Pattern:** Implemented to encapsulate algorithms and allow for interchangeable behaviors, such as calculating total receipt and applying item sales.
- **Factory Pattern:** Employed to create objects without exposing the instantiation logic, facilitating the addition of new categories and items.
- **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures that only one instance of critical classes, such as the shopping cart and user authentication, exists throughout the application lifecycle.
